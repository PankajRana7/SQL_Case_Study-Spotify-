Spotify SQL Insights Project 🎵🔍

Welcome to the heart of Spotify's music universe! 🌐✨ In this SQL analytics expedition, I dived into the dataset using powerful SQL commands. Witness the magic as I unveil the total streams of the top 100 songs, discover artists with the lowest streams, and navigate the rhythmic landscape of ranked tracks. This isn't just a data exploration; it's a symphony of SQL queries turning raw data into harmonious insights. Explore the melodies of data, where every query is a note in the grand composition of Spotify's top charts! 📊🎶🔮
